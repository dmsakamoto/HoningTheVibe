# Honing The Vibe - Best practice notes for better vibe coding

## _It's not about getting it right. It's about getting it not wrong!_

Notes on general approach

1. Develop going top-down: Lay out pages, then hone sections, then go after elements. **Do not** aim for the agent to be _perfect_.
1. Start simple, then add complexity
1. Do not commit to one agent. Pit the agents against each other.
1. **Beware!** Agents will often edit more things than necessary. _Sometimes,_ this is a feature; _sometimes,_ this is a bug.
2. **Watch the agent!** Tell it to _"STOP!"_ if it goes too far.
3. Be a bigger jerk and more direct than is comfortable.
4. Tell the agent to go back and clean up files.

## Do not do - Things that ultimately waste time

1. **Do not** try to perfect copy: just go into the source file 

## Tips to start out with better results

1. Letting the agent work off a PowerPoint is a great starting point
2. Screenshots from other agents

## Things to remember

1. Users do not know your expectations. So it does not need to be perfect to you
